# Pure-Python-Analysis
This is the project in which I use pure python (no libraries) to take some data analysis for beginner Data Scientists and to show my Python Skills.

# üìä Data Science Mini Projects

This repository contains three mini projects implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates real-world applications of data science and Python programming, including data cleaning, graph-based recommendation systems, and social network analysis.

##  1. Data Cleaning Project

**Notebook:** `data_cleaning.ipynb`

###  Overview

This notebook walks through a practical data cleaning workflow using pandas. It demonstrates:

* Identifying and handling missing data
* Fixing data types
* Removing duplicates
* Normalizing and standardizing values

###  Skills Demonstrated

* python for data manipulation
* Data preprocessing for machine learning
* Real-world handling of messy datasets

##  2. People You May Know - Social Network Graph

**Notebook:** `people_you_may_know.ipynb`

###  Overview

This notebook implements a simplified version of the "People You May Know" feature found in social networks like Facebook. It uses user connections (mutual friends) to suggest new friends.

###  How It Works

* Loads social connection data from JSON
* Builds a dictionary of user relationships
* Recommends users based on mutual friends count

###  Skills Demonstrated

* Working with nested JSON data
* Graph traversal logic using dictionaries
* Recommendation system based on user similarity

##  3. Pages You Might Like - Recommendation System

**Notebook:** `pages_you_might_like.ipynb`

###  Overview

This notebook creates a basic recommender system to suggest Facebook-like pages to a user based on others with similar page likes.

###  Key Features

* Finds shared liked pages between users
* Suggests new pages based on mutual interest
* Sorts suggestions by score (how many mutuals liked it)

###  Skills Demonstrated

* Python sets and dictionaries
* JSON file parsing
* Collaborative filtering logic

---

##  Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* json


---

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run the cells step by step

##  About

This repository is ideal for beginners in data science looking to strengthen their Python logic through realistic, hands-on problems.
